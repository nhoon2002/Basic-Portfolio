			Welcome to the Portfolio Webpage of Nam Hoon Kim, also known as "Alex". We all know Alex as a passionate and young adult who's interested in becoming the next big persona in the tech world, but nobody really knows about his background and upbringing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alex was born on April 29 at a hospital in Seoul, South Korea. As a child, Alex was just like any other child -- he enjoyed playing outside with his friends at the playground. However, Alex was born into a period of rapid technological growth, as outdoor playtime was becoming quickly replaced by video games and computer dominance with the release of the immensely popular video gaming platform Sony Playstation and the release of StarCraft on the PC. Alex showed interest in technology early, becoming interested in computer games and displaying interest in PC functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the summer the new millenium, Alex's parents decided to move the family to the States, deciding ultimately to settle in Irvine, California known for providing great education and safe haven for immigrant families. As a teen, Alex showed talent in academics, especially in math. Ultimately, Alex was accepted to the mathematics program at the prestigious UCLA.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite having majored in Mathematics, Alex knew in his heart that the theoretical concepts of mathematics alone cannot stand on its own. After graduation, Alex had a crisis in trying to find something to do with a math degree, ultimately failing to find a place to keep him happy. As a result, Alex decided to learn more coding and programming to supplement his mathematical background.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's the first big step into his newfound journey to becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs!
